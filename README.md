# Ari Dyckovsky's Curriculum Vitae via LaTeX

I use a combination of LaTeX, VS Code, and GitHub Actions to maintain and publish my curriculum vitae (CV) with versioning.

## Setup

The following must be installed to work on the CV locally:

1. A TeX distribution, preferably [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). Your `PATH` must also point to your installed TeX distribution.
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Usage

TODO.

## Acknowledgments
